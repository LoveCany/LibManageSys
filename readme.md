# LibManageSys

A Simple CPP Project

## Environment

IDE: Visual Studio 2019 Professional **(Recommended)**

## How to use

1. Get **vcpkg** (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
   
**vcpkg** is a package manager designed for C++, and all imported packages of this project (OpenSSL and jsoncpp) are installed from it. So it is a easier way to get them without complicated settings.

2. Install OpenSSL and jsoncpp

```
vcpkg install jsoncpp
vcpkg install openssl
```

notice that most of the sources are located outside China, so it may be very slow to fetch them. Try mirror sites or do something when the process seems to be stopped.

3. Clone the project and open it on Visual Studio
